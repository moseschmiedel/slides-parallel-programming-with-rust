### importance of parallel programming
- Moore's law: number of transistors in integrated circuit doubles every two years
- transistor is essential building block of modern computer systems
- more transistors => more computing power
- does not scale infinitely, because of physics
- other solution for increasing computing power of computer system
- introducing parallel code execution on multiple integrated circuits OR CPUs...
