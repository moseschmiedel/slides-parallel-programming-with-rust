### importance of parallel programming
- **answer is speed**
- transistor is essential building block of modern computer systems
- more transistors => more computing power
- does not scale infinitely, because of physics
- other solution for increasing computing power of computer system
- introducing parallel code execution on multiple integrated circuits OR CPUs...
